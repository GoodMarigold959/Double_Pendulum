# Double_Pendulum

Made for 2021 WHS Fractal Fair.

Note that the units of the program are degrees counterclockwise from a reference line that starts at the pivot of the pendulum and is perpendicular to the bottom of your screen. 

There's no license on the code. Do whatever the heck you want with it.
